        <p>A <strong>list</strong> is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an index. The values that make up a list are called its elements. Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the <strong>elements</strong> of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.</p>
        <p>There are several ways to create a new list. The simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets ( <span><code
            class="language-python">[</code></span> and <span><code
                class="language-python">]</code></span>).</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">[10, 20, 30, 40]
["spam", "bungee", "swallow"]</code></pre>
        <p>The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. As we said above, the elements of a list don't have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, another list, and even a turtle.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20], myTurtle]
</code></pre>
        <p>A list within another list is said to be <strong>nested</strong> and the inner list is often called a <strong>sublist</strong>. Finally, there is a special list that contains no elements. It is called the empty list and is denoted <span><code
            class="language-python">[]</code></span>.</p>
        <p>As you would expect, we can also assign list values to variables and pass lists as parameters to functions.</p>
