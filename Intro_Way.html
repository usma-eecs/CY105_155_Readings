        <p>The goal of the programming readings is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking
            combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians,
            computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they
            design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like
            scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.</p>
        <p>The single most important skill for a computer scientist is<strong> problem solving</strong>. Problem
            solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution
            clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
            practice problem solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, <em>The Way of the Program</em>.
        </p>
        <p>On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use
            programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.</p>
