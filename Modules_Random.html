        <p>We often want to use <strong>random numbers</strong> in programs. Here are a few typical uses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To play a game of chance where the computer needs to throw some dice, pick a number, or flip a coin,
            </li>
            <li>To shuffle a deck of playing cards randomly,</li>
            <li>To randomly allow a new enemy spaceship to appear and shoot at you,</li>
            <li>To simulate possible rainfall when we make a computerized model for estimating the environmental impact
                of building a dam,</li>
            <li>For encrypting your banking session on the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Python provides the random module that helps with tasks like this. You can take a look at it in the
            documentation at <a class="external"
                href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integers" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integers</a></p>
        <p>Here are the key things we can do with it:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">random.randint(a , b)</code></pre>
        <p>Return a random integer <em>N</em> such that  <span class = "emph">a &gt;= N &gt;= b</span></p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">random.choice(seq)</code></pre>
        <p>Return a random element from the non-empty sequence <em>seq</em>.  For
            example, <span><code class="language-python">random.choice(['red','white','blue'])</code></span> returns one of the three input colors
            randomly.</p>

        <p>Press the run button a number of times. Note that the values
            change each time. These are random numbers.</p>
        <p>The <span><code class="language-python">random.random()</code></span> function returns a floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0) - the square
            bracket means "closed interval on the left" and the round parenthesis means "open interval
            on the right". In other words, 0.0 is possible, but all returned numbers will be strictly less than
            1.0. It is usual to scale the results after calling this method, to get them into a range suitable for your
            application.</p>
        <p>In the case shown here, we've converted the result of the method call to a number in the range [0.0,
            5.0). Once more, these are uniformly distributed numbers - numbers close to 0 are just as likely to
            occur as numbers close to 0.5, or numbers close to 1.0. If you continue to press the run button you will see
            random values between 0.0 and up to but not including 5.0.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that random number generators are
            based on a <strong>deterministic</strong> algorithm - repeatable and predictable. So
            they're called<strong> pseudo-random</strong> generators - they are not genuinely
            random. They start with a <em>seed</em> value. Each time you ask for another random number,
            you'll get one based on the current seed attribute, and the state of the seed (which is one of the
            attributes of the generator) will be updated. The good news is that each time you run your program, the seed
            value is likely to be different meaning that even though the random numbers are being created
            algorithmically, you will likely get random behavior each time you execute.</p>
