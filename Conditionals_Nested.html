        <p>One conditional can also be <strong>nested</strong> within another. For example, assume we have two
            integer variables, <span class="emph">x</span> and <span class="emph">y</span>. 
            The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how
            they are related to each other.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">if x != y:
    print("x and y are not equal")
    if x &gt; y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x must be less than y")
else:
    print("x and y are equal")
</code></pre>
        <p>The outer conditional contains two branches. The second branch (the else from the outer) contains
            another <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain
            conditional statements as well.</p>
        <p>The flow of control for this example can be seen in this flowchart illustration.</p>
        <img src="Images/ConditionalStatements_Nested.png">
        <p>Here is a complete program that defines values for <span class="emph">x</span> and <span
                class="emph">y</span>.
            Run the program and see the result. Then change the values of the variables to change the flow of control.

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In some programming languages, matching the <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> and the 
            <span><code class="language-python">else</code></span> is a problem. However, in
            Python this is not the case. The indentation pattern tells us exactly which else belongs to which if.</p>
