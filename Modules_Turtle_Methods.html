        <p>To see an exhaustive list of everything you can do with the turtle module, visit the <a
                href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">turtles documentation page</a> on the python.org website. Here you will discover all
            the amazing things that can be done with turtles. There is also a lot of sample code (like the Turtle Star)
            demonstrating how easily cool sketches can be created.</p>
        <p>The best way to learn how to use the turtle module is to practice. The code below demonstrates some of the
            turtle module functionality. Remember to use your reference card as it will help with the exact
            <i>syntax</i> required for your code to execute properly.</p>
        <p>The following functionality is demonstrated below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.penup()</code></span></li>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.goto()</code></span></li>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.pendown()</code></span></li>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.fillcolor()</code></span></li>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.circle()</code></span></li>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.xcor()</code></span></li>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">.ycor()</code></span></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Here are a few more things that you might find useful as you write programs that use turtles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances. So <span><code class="language-python">tess.forward(-100)</code></span> will move tess
                    backwards, and <span><code class="language-python">tess.left(-30)</code></span> turns
                    her to the right. Additionally, because there are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the left
                    will leave you facing in the same direction as turning 330 to the right! (The on-screen animation
                    will differ, though - you will be able to tell if tess is turning clockwise or
                    counter-clockwise!)</p>
                <p>This suggests that we don't need both a left and a right turn method - we could be
                    minimalists, and just have one method. There is also a backward method. (If you are very nerdy, you
                    might enjoy saying <span><code class="language-python">alex.backward(-100)</code></span> to move alex
                    forward!)</p>
                <p>Part of thinking like a scientist is to understand more of the structure and rich relationships in
                    your field. So reviewing a few basic facts about geometry and number lines, like we've done
                    here is a good start if we're going to play with turtles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>A turtle's pen can be picked up or put down. This allows us to move a turtle to a different place
                without drawing a line. The methods are <span><code class="language-python">.penup()</code></span> and 
                <span><code class="language-python">.pendown()</code></span>.
                <pre><code class="language-python">alex.penup()
alex.forward(100)     # this moves alex, but no line is drawn
alex.pendown()</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Every turtle can have its own shape. The ones available "out of the box" are 
                <span><code class="language-python">"arrow"</code></span>, 
                <span><code class="language-python">"blank"</code></span>, 
                <span><code class="language-python">"circle"</code></span>, 
                <span><code class="language-python">"classic"</code></span>, 
                <span><code class="language-python">"square"</code></span>, 
                <span><code class="language-python">"triangle"</code></span>, 
                <span><code class="language-python">"turtle"</code></span>.
                So <span><code class="language-python">alex.shape("turtle")</code></span> will set alex's shape to a turtle
            </li>
            <li>You can speed up or slow down the turtle's animation speed. (Animation controls how quickly the
                turtle turns and moves forward). Speed settings can be set between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fast). But if
                you set the speed to 0, it has a special meaning - turn off animation and go as fast as possible.
                For example: <span><code class="language-python">alex.speed(5)</code></span> will set alex's speed to 5
            </li>
            <li>A turtle can "stamp" its footprint onto the canvas, and this will remain after the turtle
                has moved somewhere else. Stamping works even when the pen is up.</li>
