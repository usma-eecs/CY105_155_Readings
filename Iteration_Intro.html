        <p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making
            errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.</p>
        <p>Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called <strong>iteration</strong> and is used to
            simplify our programs. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it
            easier.</p>
        <p>We will look at both the <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> and <span><code
                    class="language-python">while</code></span> loops. The for statement
            will always iterate through a sequence of values like the list of names for the party or the list of numbers
            created by range which you will see below. Since we know that it will iterate once for each value in the
            collection, it is often said that a for loop creates a <strong>definite iteration</strong> because we
            definitely know how many times we are going to iterate. On the other hand,
            the <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> statement is dependent on a condition that needs
            to evaluate to <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span> in order for the loop to terminate. 
            Since we do  not necessarily know when this will happen, it creates what we call <strong>indefinite iteration</strong>. Indefinite iteration simply
            means that we don't know how many times we will repeat but eventually the condition controlling the
            iteration will fail and the iteration will stop. (Unless we have an infinite loop which is of course a
            problem.)</p>
