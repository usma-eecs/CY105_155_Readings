        <p>It is also possible to perform <strong>list traversal</strong> using iteration by item as well as iteration
            by index.</p>

        <p>It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in
            (the list of) fruits, print (the name of the) fruit.</p>
        <p>We can also use the indices to access the items in an iterative fashion.</p>
        <p><iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/ListTraversal2"></iframe></p>
        <p>In this example, each time through the loop, the variable <span class = "emph">position</span> is used as an index into the list,
            printing the <span class = "emph">position</span>-eth element. Note that
            we used <span><code class="language-python">len(fruits)</code></span> as the upper bound on the range
            so that we can iterate correctly no matter how many items are in the list.</p>
        <p>Since lists are mutable, it is often desirable to traverse a list, modifying each of its elements as you go.
            The following code squares all the numbers from <span class = "emph">1</span> to <span class = "emph">5</span> using iteration by position.</p>

        <p>Take a moment to think about <span><code class="language-python">range(len(numbers))</code></span> until you understand how
            it works. We are interested here in both the <span class = "emph">value</span> and its <span class = "emph">index</span> within the list, so that
            we can assign a new value to it.</p>
