        <p>If problem solving is a central part of computer science, then the solutions that you create through the
            problem solving process are also important. In computer science, we refer to these solutions as algorithms.
            An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will
            solve the problem under consideration.</p>
        <p>Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general
            solution. Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate the execution. As noted above,
            programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation
            (a program) that can be followed by a computer. These programs are written in programming languages.</p>
