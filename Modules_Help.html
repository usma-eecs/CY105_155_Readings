        <p>A <strong>module </strong>is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other
            Python programs. These are useful because they allow programmers to use previously written code in other
            programs without needing to copy all of it into the new program. There are many Python modules that come
            with Python as part of the <strong>standard library</strong>. Once we import the module, we can use things that are defined inside.
        </p>
        <p>Here we are using <span><code class="language-python">turtle.Screen()</code></span>and <span><code
            class="language-python">turtle.Turtle()</code></span>, both of which are defined inside the
            turtle module.</p>
        <p>But what if no one had told us about turtle? How would we know that it exists? How would we know
            what it can do for us? The answer is to ask for help and the best place to get help about the Python
            programming environment is to consult with the Python Documentation.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python Documentation</a> site for
            Python version 3 (the home page is shown below) is an extremely useful reference for all aspects of Python.
            The site contains a listing of all the standard modules that are available with Python (see <a
                href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Module
                Index)</a>. You will also see that there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Language Reference</a> and a <a
                href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutorial</a> (mostly
            aimed at people who are already familiar with another programming language), as well as installation
            instructions, how-tos, and frequently asked questions. We encourage you to become familiar with this site
            and to use it often.</p>
        <p>If you have not done so already, take a look at the Global Module Index. Here you will see an alphabetical
            listing of all the modules that are available as part of the <strong>standard library</strong>. Find the
            turtle module.</p>

        <p>You can see that all the turtle functionality that we will cover in class (see your reference card) there. However, there is so much
            more.
