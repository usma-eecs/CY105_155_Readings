        <p>So far we have seen built-in types like <span><code>int</code></span>, <span
                style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #c0c0c0;">float</span>, <span
                style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #c0c0c0;">bool</span>, <span
                style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #c0c0c0;">str</span> and we&rsquo;ve seen lists.&nbsp; The
            types&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #c0c0c0; color: #ff0000;">int</span>, <span
                style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #c0c0c0;">float</span>, and <span
                style="color: #ff0000; background-color: #c0c0c0;">bool</span> are considered to be simple or primitive
            data types because their values are not composed of any smaller parts. They cannot be broken down. On the
            other hand, lists are different from the others because they are made up of smaller pieces.</p>
        <p>Types that are comprised of smaller pieces are called <strong>collection data types</strong>. Depending on
            what we are doing, we may want to treat a collection data type as a single entity (the whole), or we may
            want to access its parts. This ambiguity is useful.</p>
        <p>A list that contains no items, often referred to as the <strong>empty list</strong>, is still considered to
            be a list. It is simply a sequence of zero items and is represented by [] (two square brackets with nothing
            in between).</p>
