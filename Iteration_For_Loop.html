        <p>The <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop repeats once for each item in a list or character in a string. Each item in turn is (re-)assigned to the <em>loop
                variable</em>, and the body of the loop is executed. In Python, the <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span>
                statement allows us to write programs that implement iteration. As a simple example, let's say
                we have some friends, and we'd like to send them each an email inviting them to our party. We
                don't quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we'll just print a message for
                each friend.</p>
        
        <p>In the image and example below, the red arrow points to what line of code is about to execute.
            The <i>next</i> button tells it to run the next line of code. The <i>Print output</i> box at the top right is similar to the console window
            in Replit. Finally, at the bottom left, you'll see the variable <span><code class="language-python">name</code></span> and the value
            it's currently assigned. Watch what happens to the <span><code class="language-python">name's</code></span> value as you step through
            the code using the <i>next</i> button. here is one line printed for each friend.

            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><code class="language-python">name</code></span> in this <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> 
                statement is called the <strong>loop variable</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>The list of names in the square brackets is called a Python <strong>list</strong>. Lists are very useful.
                We will have much more to say about them later.</li>
            <li>Line 2 is the <strong>loop body</strong>. The loop body is always indented. The indentation determines
                exactly what statements are "in the loop". The loop body is performed one time for each name in the
                list.</li>
            <li>On each <strong>iteration</strong> or pass of the loop, a check is done to see if there are still more items to
                be processed. If there are none left (this is called the <i>terminating condition</i> of the
                loop), the loop has finished. Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body.
            </li>
            <li>If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the next item in the
                list. This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed here 7 times, and each time 
                <span><code class="language-python">name</code></span> will be assigned the name of a different friend.</li>
            <li>At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns to the <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> 
                statement, to see if there are more items to be handled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below we see an example of using a <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop to repeat the same turtle actions, simplifying our program.
         Complete the program to repeat the steps 5 times.</p>
        <p><iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/IterationFor2"></iframe></p>
        <p>We can use the <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop to implement an <strong>accumulator pattern </strong>(we'll discuss this more
            shortly). For example, to compute the sum of the first <span class = "emph">n</span> integers, we could create a <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop using
            the range to produce the numbers <span><code class="language-python">1</code></span> through <span><code class="language-python">a_bound</code></span>. Using the 
            <strong>accumulator pattern</strong>, we can start with a running total variable initialized to <span class = "emph">0</span> and on each iteration, 
            add the current value of the <strong>loop variable</strong>. A program to compute this sum is shown below.</p>
        <p><iframe width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=a_bound%20%3D%20int%28float%28input%28%22Enter%20a%20number%20to%20sum%20to%3A%20%22%29%29%29%0Athe_sum%20%3D%200%0Afor%20a_number%20in%20range%281,%20a_bound%20%2B%201%29%3A%0A%20%20the_sum%20%3D%20the_sum%20%2B%20a_number%0A%0Aprint%28the_sum%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe></p>
        <p>To review, the variable <span><code class="language-python">the_sum</code></span> is called the <strong>accumulator</strong>. It is initialized to zero before we start the loop. The loop variable, 
            <span><code class="language-python">a_number</code></span> will take on the values produced by the <span><code class="language-python">range(1, a_bound + 1)</code></span> 
            function call. Note that this produces all the integers from <span><code class="language-python">1</code></span> up to the value of <span><code class="language-python">a_bound</code></span>. If we had not added 1 to aBound, the range would have stopped one
            value short since range does not include the upper bound.</p>
        <p>The assignment statement, <span><code class="language-python">the_sum = the_sum + a_number</code></span>, updates <span><code class="language-python">the_sum</code></span>
            each time through the loop. This accumulates the running total. Finally, we print the value of the accumulator.</p>
