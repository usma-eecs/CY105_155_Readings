        <p>One of the most important skills you need to acquire to complete this book successfully is the ability to
            debug your programs. Debugging might be the most under-appreciated, and under-taught, skill in introductory
            computer science. For that reason, we are introducing a series of "debugging interludes." Debugging
            is a skill that you need to master over time, and some of the tips and tricks are specific to different
            aspects of Python programming. So look for additional debugging interludes throughout the rest of this book.</p>
        <p>Programming is an odd thing in a way. Here is why. As programmers, we spend 99% of our time trying to get our
            program to work. We struggle, we stress, we spend hours deep in frustration trying to get our program to
            execute correctly. Then when we do get it going, we celebrate, hand it in, and move on to the next homework
            assignment or programming task. But here is the secret, when you are successful, you are happy, and your
            brain releases a bit of chemical that makes you feel good. You need to organize your programming so that you
            have lots of little successes. It turns out your brain doesn't care all that much if you have
            successfully written hello world or a fast Fourier transform (trust me it's hard) you still get that little
            release that makes you happy. When you are happy you want to go on and solve the next little problem.
            Essentially I'm telling you once again, start small, get something small working, and then add to it.
