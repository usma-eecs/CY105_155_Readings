        There is another Python statement that can also be used to build an iteration. It is called the <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span>
        statement. The <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> statement provides a much more general mechanism 
        for iterating. Similar to a repeated  <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statement, it uses a
        <strong>boolean</strong> expression to control the flow of execution. The body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean
            expression evaluates to  <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span>.
    </p>
    <p>The following figure shows the flow of control.</p>
    <p><img src="Images/While_Loop_Flow.png" alt="While Flow" height="400" /></p>
    <p>We can use the <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> loop to create any type of iteration we
        wish, including anything that we have previously done with a  <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop. 
        For example, the program in the previous section could be rewritten using  <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span>.
        Instead of relying on the  <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span> function to produce the numbers for our summation, 
        we will need to produce them ourselves. To to this, we will create a variable named  <span><code class="language-python">a_number</code></span>
        and initialize (set it's initial value) it to <span class ="emph">1</span>, the first number in the summation. Every iteration will add <span><code class="language-python">a_number</code></span>
        to the running total until all the values have been used. In order to control the iteration, we must create a
        boolean expression that evaluates to <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span> as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total. 
        In this case, as long as <span><code class="language-python">a_number</code></span> is less than or equal to the <span><code class="language-python">a_bound</code></span>, we should keep going.</p>
    <p>Here is a new version of the summation program that uses a <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> statement. Watch how the varibles change as
        the program repeats lines 4, 5, and 6.

    <p>You can almost read the <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> statement as if it were in natural
        language. It means, while aNumber is less than or equal to aBound, continue executing the body of the loop.
        Within the body, each time, update theSum using the accumulator pattern and increment aNumber. After the body of
        the loop, we go back up to the condition of the while and reevaluate it. When aNumber becomes greater than
        aBound, the condition fails and flow of control continues to the return statement.</p>
    <p>More formally, here is the flow of execution for a <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> statement:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Evaluate the condition, yielding <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span> or <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span>.</li>
        <li>If the condition is <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span>, exit the <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> statement and continue execution at the next statement.</li>
        <li>If the condition is <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span>, execute each of the statements in the body and then go back to step 1.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The body consists of all of the statements below the header with the same indentation.</p>
    <p>This type of flow is called a <strong>loop</strong> because the third step loops back around to the top. Notice
        that if the condition is <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span> the first time through the loop, the statements inside the loop are never
        executed.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Though Python's while is very close to the English "while", there is an important
        difference: In English "while X, do Y", we usually assume that immediately after X becomes false, we stop with
        Y. In Python there is not an immediate stop: After the initial test, any following tests come only after the
        execution of the whole body, even if the condition becomes false in the middle of the loop body.</p>
    <p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes
        <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span> and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever. 
        This is called an <strong>infinite loop</strong>. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions
        written on the back of the shampoo bottle (lather, rinse, repeat) create an infinite loop.</p>
    <p>In the case shown above, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the value of <span><code class="language-python">a_bound</code></span> is
        finite, and we can see that the value of <span><code class="language-python">a_nound</code></span> increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will
        have to exceed <span><code class="language-python">a_bound</code></span>. In other cases, it is not so easy to tell.</p>
    <p>What you will notice here is that the <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> loop is more work for you - the programmer - 
        than the equivalent <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop. When using a <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> loop 
        you have to control the loop variable yourself. You give it an initial value, test for completion, and then make sure you change 
        something in the body so that the loop terminates.</p>
