        <p>Perhaps the most important lesson in debugging is that it is <strong>largely
                avoidable</strong> - if you work carefully.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify a correct solution</strong> You must have a firm grasp on what constitutes a
                correct solution - what the program should do in specific circumstances - what output should
                be produced for some given input. You need to understand <strong>what</strong> you are trying
                to accomplish but not necessarily <strong>how</strong> to do it. You can then identify whether
                there remains work to do or bugs to correct. This is probably the single biggest piece of advice for
                programmers at every level.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Small</strong> It is tempting to sit down and crank out an entire program at once.
                But, when the program - inevitably - does not work, you have a myriad of options for things
                that might be wrong. Where to start? Where to look first? How to figure out what went wrong? I'll
                get to that in the next section. So, start with something really small. Maybe just two lines and then
                make sure that runs ok. Hitting the run button is quick and easy, and gives you immediate feedback about
                whether what you have just done is ok or not. Another immediate benefit of having something small
                working is that you have something to turn in. Turning in a small, incomplete program, is almost always
                better than nothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep improving</strong> it Once you have a small part of your program working the next step
                is to figure out something small to add to it - how can you move closer to a correct solution. If
                you keep adding small pieces of the program one at a time, it is much easier to figure out what went
                wrong, as it is most likely that the problem is going to be in the new code you have just added. Less
                new code means its easier to figure out where the problem is.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This notion of <strong>Get something working and keep improving it</strong> is a mantra that you
            can repeat throughout your career as a programmer. It's a great way to avoid the frustrations
            mentioned above. Think of it this way. Every time you have a little success, your brain releases a tiny bit
            of chemical that makes you happy. So, you can keep yourself happy and make programming more enjoyable by
            creating lots of small victories for yourself.</p>
        <p>Ok, let's look at a simple example problem</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask the user for the time now (in hours 0 - 23), and ask for the number of hours
                to wait</li>
            <li>Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off. For example,
                if <span class = "emph">current_time</span> is 8 and <span class = "emph">wait_time</span> is 5, <span class = "emph">final_time</span> should be 13 (1 pm).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, where to start? The problem requires two pieces of input from the user, so let's start there and
            make sure we can get the data we need.</p>

        <p>So far so good. Now let's take the next step. We need to figure out what the time will be after waiting
            <span class = "emph">wait_time</span> number of hours. A reasonable solution is to simply add wait_time to <span class = "emph">current_time</span> and print out
            the result. So let's try that.</p>
        <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=current_time%20%3D%20input%28%22What%20is%20the%20current%20time%20%28in%20hours%29%3F%20%22%29%0Await_time%20%3D%20input%28%22How%20many%20hours%20do%20you%20want%20to%20wait%3F%20%22%29%0A%0Aprint%28current_time%29%0Aprint%28wait_time%29%0A%0Afinal_time%20%3D%20current_time%20%2B%20wait_time%0Aprint%28final_time%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=2&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%2222%22,%225%22%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>
        <p> Hmm, you can see that something unexpected has happened. You would
            not realize this was an error unless you first knew what the program was supposed to do.</p>
        <p>This error was probably pretty simple to spot, because we printed out the value of final_time and
            it is easy to see that the numbers were just concatenated together rather than added.</p>
        <p>So what do we do about the problem? We will need to convert
            both <span class = "emph">current_time</span> and <span class = "emph">wait_time</span> to int. At this stage of your programming
            development, it can be a good idea to include the type of the variable in the variable name itself. So
            let's look at another iteration of the program that does that, and the conversion to integer.</p>
        <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=current_time_str%20%3D%20input%28%22What%20is%20the%20current%20time%20%28in%20hours%29%3F%20%22%29%0Await_time_str%20%3D%20input%28%22How%20many%20hours%20do%20you%20want%20to%20wait%3F%20%22%29%0A%0Acurrent_time_int%20%3D%20int%28current_time_str%29%0Await_time_int%20%3D%20int%28wait_time_str%29%0A%0Afinal_time_int%20%3D%20current_time_int%20%2B%20wait_time_int%0Aprint%28final_time_int%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=2&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%2222%22,%225%22%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>
        <p>Now, that's a lot better, and in fact depending on the hours
            you chose, it may be exactly right. If you entered 8 for <span class = "emph">current_time</span> and 5 for <span class = "emph">wait_time</span> then 13 is
            correct. But if you entered 22 (10 pm) for <span class = "emph">current_time</span> and 5 for <span class = "emph">wait_time</span> then the result of 27 is not
            correct.</p>
        <p>This illustrates an important aspect of <strong>testing</strong>: it is important to test your code on a
            range of inputs. It is especially important to test your code on <strong>boundary conditions</strong>.
            For this particular problem, you should test your program with <span class = "emph">current_time</span> of 0, 23, and some
            values in between. You should test your <span class = "emph">wait_time</span> for 0, and some larger values. What about
            negative numbers? Negative numbers don't make sense, and since we don't really have the tools to
            deal with telling the user when something is wrong we will not worry about that just yet.</p>
        <p>So to account for those numbers that are bigger than 23, we need one final step: using the modulus operator.
        </p>

        <p>Of course even in this simple progression, there are other
            ways you could have gone astray. We'll look at some of those and how you track them down in the next
            section</p>
