        <p>There are three <strong>logical operators</strong>: <span><code class="language-python">and</code></span>,
            <span><code class="language-python">or</code></span>, and <span><code
                    class="language-python">not</code></span>. The semantics
            (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, <span><code
                    class="language-python">x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 10</code></span> is <span><code
                    class="language-python">True</code></span>
            only if x is greater than 0 <em>and</em> at the same time, x is less
            than 10. How would you describe this in words? You would say that x is between 0 and 10, not including the
            endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>Similarly, <span><code class="language-python">n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0</code></span> is <span><code
                    class="language-python">True</code></span> if <em>either</em> of the conditions is <span><code
                    class="language-python">True</code></span>, that is, if the
            number is divisible by 2 <em>or</em> divisible by 3. In this case, one, or the other, or both of
            the parts has to be <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span> for the result to be <span><code
                    class="language-python">True</code></span>.</p>
        <p>Finally, the <span><code class="language-python">not</code></span> operator negates a boolean expression, so
            <span><code class="language-python">not x &gt; y</code></span> is <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span>
             if <span><code class="language-python">x &gt; y</code></span> is <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span>, that is, if x is less than or equal to y.</p>

        <h3>Common Mistake!</h3>
        <p>There is a very common mistake that occurs when programmers try to write boolean expressions. For example,
            what if we have a variable number and we want to check to see if its value is 5, 6, or 7. In words
            we might say: "number equal to 5 or 6 or 7". However, if we translate this into
            Python, <span><code class="language-python">number == 5 or 6 or 7</code></span>, it will not be correct. The or operator must join the results of three
            equality checks. The correct way to write this is <span><code class="language-python">number == 5 or number == 6 or number == 7</code></span>. This may
            seem like a lot of typing but it is absolutely necessary. You cannot take a shortcut.</p>
        <p>Here we will show two brief examples.</p>
        <p>1. Assume that you want to check if a someone is a teenager. You would need a check that they are between 13
            and 19 years old. Your conditional statement may look like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">(13 &lt;= Age) and (Age &lt;= 19)</code></pre>
        <p>From the order of precedence given in the previous section, you should see that Python will first check the
            comparison on the left, then the comparison on the right, and finally use the <em>and</em> operator to see
            if both checks returned a boolean <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span>.</p>
        <p>2. Assume that you are playing a game with three dice: two regular six-sided die and one colored die. If
            you roll three or less on both of the numbered dice or roll a green on the colored die, you win some prize.
            In that case, our conditional statement could look like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">(die1 == "green") or ((die2 &lt;= 3) and (die3 &lt;= 3))</code></pre>
        <p>You can read this statement as: if die1 is colored green OR if die2 is less than or equal to three AND die3
            is less than or equal to three, return a <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span> otherwise return a <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span>.</p>
        <p>Finally, you can combine as many comparisons as you wish using additional <span><code class="language-python">and</code></span>/<span><code class="language-python">or</code></span> operators.</p>
