        <p>It is important to understand that each of the functions we write can be used and called from other functions
            we write. This is one of the most important ways that computer scientists take a large problem and break it
            down into a group of smaller problems. This process of breaking a problem into smaller subproblems is called
            <strong>functional decomposition</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a simple example of functional decomposition using two functions. The first function called square
            simply computes the square of a given number. The second function called sum_of_squares makes use of square
            to compute the sum of three numbers that have been squared.</p>

        <p>Even though this is a pretty simple idea, in practice this
            example illustrates many very important Python concepts, including local and global variables along with
            parameter passing. Note that when you step through this example, Python Tutor bolds line 1 and line 5 as the
            functions are defined. The body of <span><code class="language-python">square()</code></span> is not
            executed until it is called from the sum_of_squares
            function for the first time on line 6. Also notice that when <span><code
                    class="language-python">square()</code></span> is called there are two groups of local
            variables, one for <span><code class="language-python">square()</code></span> and one for <span><code
                    class="language-python">sum_of_squares()</code></span>. As you step through you will notice that x,
            and y are
            local variables in both functions and may even have different values. This illustrates that even though they
            are named the same, they are in fact, very different.</p>
        <p>Now we will look at another example that uses two functions. This example illustrates an important computer
            science problem solving technique called <strong>generalization</strong>. Assume we want to write a function
            to draw a square. The generalization step is to realize that a square is just a special kind of rectangle.
        </p>
        <p>To draw a rectangle we need to be able to call a function with different arguments for width and height.
            Unlike the case of the square, we cannot repeat the same thing 4 times, because the four sides are not
            equal. However, it is the case that drawing the bottom and right sides are the same sequence as drawing the
            top and left sides. So we eventually come up with this rather nice code that can draw a rectangle.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">def drawRectangle(t, w, h):
    """Get turtle t to draw a rectangle of width w and height h."""
    for i in range(2):
        t.forward(w)
        t.left(90)
        t.forward(h)
        t.left(90)
</code></pre>
        <p>The parameter names are chosen as single letters for conciseness. In real programs, we will insist on better
            variable names than this. The point is that the program doesn't "understand" that you're drawing
            a rectangle or that the parameters represent the width and the height. Concepts like rectangle, width, and
            height are meaningful for humans. They are not concepts that the program or the computer understands.</p>
        <p><em>Thinking like a computer scientist</em> involves looking for patterns and relationships. In the code
            above, we've done that to some extent. We did not just draw four sides. Instead, we spotted that we could
            draw the rectangle as two halves and used a loop to repeat that pattern twice.</p>
        <p>But now we might spot that a square is a special kind of rectangle. A square simply uses the same value for
            both the height and the width. We already have a function that draws a rectangle, so we can use that to draw
            our square.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">def drawSquare(tx, sz):        # a new version of drawSquare
    drawRectangle(tx, sz, sz)
</code></pre>
        <p>Here is the entire example with the necessary set up code.</p>

        <p>There are some points worth noting here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions can call other functions.</li>
            <li>Rewriting <span><code class="language-python">drawSquare()</code></span> like this captures the
                relationship that we've spotted.</li>
            <li>A caller of this function might say <span><code
                        class="language-python">drawSquare(tess, 50)</code></span>. The parameters of this function,
                <span class="emph">tx</span> and <span class="emph">sz</span>, are assigned the values of the <span
                    class="emph">tess</span> object,
                and the integer 50 respectively.</li>
            <li>In the body of the function, <span class="emph">tx</span> and <span class="emph">sz</span> are just like
                any other variable.</li>
            <li>When the call is made to <span><code class="language-python">drawRectangle()</code></span>, the values
                in variables <span class="emph">tx</span> and <span class="emph">sz</span> are fetched first, then the
                call happens. So as we enter the top of function
                <span><code class="language-python">drawRectangle()</code></span>, its variable <span
                    class="emph">t</span> is assigned the <span
                    class="emph">tess</span> object, and <span
                    class="emph">w</span> and <span
                    class="emph">h</span> in that function are both given
                the value 50.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to create all of these new functions. Actually, there
            are a lot of reasons, but this example demonstrates two:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a
                program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command. The function (including its name) can
                capture your mental chunking, or <em>abstraction</em>, of the problem.</li>
            <li>Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you can write functions that allow you to solve a specific problem using a more general
                solution.</li>
        </ol>
