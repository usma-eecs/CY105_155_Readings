        <p>Just like we can have many different integers in a program, we can have an unlimited number of turtles. Each
            of them is an independent object and we call each one an <strong>instance</strong> of the Turtle type
            (class). Each instance has its own attributes and methods - so <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span> might draw with a thin black pen
            and be at some position, while <span><code class="language-python">tess</code></span> might be going in her own direction with a fat pink pen. So here is what
            happens when <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span> completes a square and <span><code class="language-python">tess</code></span> completes her triangle:</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/ModulesTurtleHerd"></iframe>
        <p>Here are some observations on how to think like a computer scientist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are 360 degrees in a full circle. If you add up all the turns that a turtle makes, <em>no matter
                what steps occurred between the turns</em>, you can easily figure out if they add up to some
                multiple of 360. This should convince you that <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span>
                is facing in exactly the same direction as he was
                when he was first created. (Geometry conventions have 0 degrees facing East and that is the case here
                too!)</li>
            <li>We could have left out the last turn for <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span>, but that would not have been as satisfying. If
                you're asked to draw a closed shape like a square or a rectangle, it is a good idea to complete
                all the turns and to leave the turtle back where it started, facing the same direction as it started in.
                This makes reasoning about the program and composing chunks of code into bigger programs easier for us
                humans!</li>
            <li>We did the same with <span><code class="language-python">tess</code></span>: she drew her triangle and turned through a full 360 degrees. Then we turned
                her around and moved her aside. Even the blank line 19 is a hint about how the programmer's
                <em>mental chunking</em> is working: in big terms, <span><code class="language-python">tess</code></span>'s movements were chunked as "draw the
                triangle" (lines 12-17) and then "move away from the origin" (lines 19 and 20).</li>
            <li>One of the key uses for comments is to record your mental chunking, and big ideas. They're not
                always explicit in the code.</li>
            <li>And, uh-huh, two turtles may not be enough for a herd, but you get the idea!</li>
        </ul>
