        <p>In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the
            behavior of the program accordingly. <strong>Selection statements</strong>, sometimes also referred to
            as <strong>conditional statements</strong>, give us this ability. The simplest form of selection is
            the <strong>if statement</strong>. This is sometimes referred to as <strong>binary
                selection</strong> since there are two possible paths of execution.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/ConditionalsBinarySelection"></iframe>
        <p>The syntax for an <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statement looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENTS_1        # executed if condition evaluates to True
else:
    STATEMENTS_2        # executed if condition evaluates to False
</code></pre>
        <p>The boolean expression after the <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statement is called
            the <strong>condition</strong>. If it is <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span> , then the immediately following indented
            statements get executed. If not, then the statements indented under the <span><code class="language-python">else:</code></span> clause get
            executed.</p>
        <img src = "Images/ConditionalStatements_BinaryIfElse.png">
        <p>As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound statements like <em>for</em>,
            the <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statement consists of a header line and a body. The header line begins with the
            keyword <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> followed by a boolean expression and ends with a colon (:).</p>
        <p>The more indented statements that follow are called a <strong>block</strong>.</p>
        <p>Each of the statements inside the first block of statements is executed in order if the boolean expression
            evaluates to <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span>. The entire first block of statements is skipped if the boolean expression
            evaluates to <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span>, and instead all the statements under the <em>else </em>clause
            are executed.</p>
        <p>There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of
            an <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.</p>
        <p>Each compound statement includes a heading and all the following further-indented statements in the block
            after the heading. The if - else statement is an unusual compound statement because it
            has more than one part at the same level of indentation as the <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> heading,
            (the <span><code class="language-python">else</code></span> clause, with its own indented block).</p>
