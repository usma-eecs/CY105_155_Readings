        <p>In Python, a <strong>function</strong> is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their
            primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the solution to
            the problem and to allow us to use the same code block of code from multiple places in our program..</p>
        <p>The syntax for a<strong> function definition</strong> is:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">def name( parameters ):
    statements</code></pre>
        <p>You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that you can't use a name that
            is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal variable names (identifiers) that were
            given previously.
            The parameters specify what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use the new function.
            Another way to say this is that the parameters specify what the function needs to do its work. For example,
            if you write a function to square a number, the parameter that the function needs is the number that will
            be squared.
        </p>
        <p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the <span><code class="language-python">def</code></span>. In
            the examples in this book, we will use the standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are another 
            <strong>compound statement</strong>, all of which have the same
            pattern:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.</li>
            <li>A <strong>body</strong> consisting of one or more Python statements, each indented the same
                amount - <em>4 spaces is the Python standard</em> - from the header line.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We've already seen the <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> and <span><code class="language-python">while</code></span> loops and the 
            <span><code class="language-python">if</code></span> statements which follows this pattern.</p>
        <p>In a function definition, the keyword in the header is <span><code class="language-python">def</code></span>, which is followed by the name of the
            function and some parameters enclosed in parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any
            number of parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.</p>
        <p>We need to say a bit more about the parameters. In the definition, the parameter list is more specifically
            known as the <strong>formal parameters</strong>. This list of names describes those things that the
            function will need to receive from the user of the function. When you use a function, you provide values to
            the formal parameters.</p>
        <p>The figure below shows this relationship. A function needs certain information to do its work. These values,
            often called <strong>arguments</strong> or <strong>actual parameters</strong>, are passed to
            the function by the user.</p>
        <p><img src="Images/Functions_01_BlackBoxDiagram.png" /></p>
        <p>This type of diagram is often called a <strong>black-box diagram</strong> because it only states
            the requirements from the perspective of the user. The user must know the name of the function and what
            arguments need to be passed. The details of how the function works are hidden inside the
            "black-box".</p>
        <p>Suppose we're working with turtles and a common operation we need is to draw squares. It would make
            sense if we did not have to duplicate all the steps each time we want to make a square. "Draw a
            square" can be thought of as an <em>abstraction</em> of a number of smaller steps. We will
            need to provide two pieces of information for the function to do its work: a turtle to do the drawing and a
            size for the side of the square. We could represent this using the following black-box diagram.</p>
        <p><img src="Images/Functions_01_TurtleBlackBox.png" /></p>
        <p>Here is a program containing a function to capture this idea. Give it a try.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/WritingFunctionsTurtleSquare"></iframe>
        <p>This function is named <span class="emph">drawSquare</span>. It has two parameters - one to tell the function which turtle
            to move around and the other to tell it the size of the square we want drawn. In the function definition
            they are called <span class="emph">t</span> and <span class="emph">sz</span> respectively. Make sure you know where the body of the function
            ends - it depends on the indentation and the blank lines don't count for this purpose!</p>
        <p>Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a <strong>function
                call</strong>. This is also known as a <strong>function invocation</strong>. We've already
            seen how to call some built-in functions like <span><code class="language-python">print()</code></span>, 
            <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span>, and <span><code class="language-python">int()</code></span>. Function calls
            contain the name of the function to be executed followed by a list of values in parentheses, called
            arguments, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition. So in the second to the last
            line of the program, we call the function, and pass <span class="emph">alex</span> as the turtle to be manipulated, and 50
            as the size of the square we want.</p>
        <p>Once we've defined a function, we can call it as often as we like and its statements will be executed
            each time we call it. In this case, we could use it to get one of our turtles to draw a square and then we
            can move the turtle and have it draw a different square in a different location. Note that we lift the tail
            so that when <span class="emph">alex</span> moves there is no trace. We put the tail back down before drawing the next
            square. Make sure you can identify both invocations of the <span class="emph">drawSquare</span> function.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/WritingFunctionsTurtleSquare2"></iframe>
        <p>In the next example, we've changed the <span class="emph">drawSquare</span> function a little and we
            get <span class="emph">tess</span> to draw 15 squares with some variations. Once the function has been defined, we can call
            it as many times as we like with whatever actual parameters we like.</p>
            <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/WritingFunctionsTurtleSquare3"></iframe>
        <p><span class="text-dark bg-warning">Warning</span>: Even if a function call needs no arguments, the parentheses ( ) after the
            function name are <em>required</em>. This can lead to a difficult bug: A function name without the
            parenthesis is a legal expression <em>referring</em> to the function; for
            example, <span><code class="language-python">print</code></span> and <span><code class="language-python">alex.penup</code></span>, but they do not <em>call</em> the associated
            functions.</p>
