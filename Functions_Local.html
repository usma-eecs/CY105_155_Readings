        <p>An assignment statement in a function creates a <strong>local variable</strong> for the variable on
            the left hand side of the assignment operator. It is called local because this variable only exists inside
            the function and you cannot use it outside. For example, consider again the square function:</p>
        <p><iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20square%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20y%20%3D%20x%20*%20x%0A%20%20return%20y%0A%0Az%20%3D%20square%2810%29%0Aprint%28y%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe></p>
        <p> Press the Next > button through to the end and you will see an error
            message. When we try to use y on line 6 (outside the function) Python looks for a global variable named y
            but does not find one. This results in the error: <span class="emph">Name Error: 'y' is not defined.</span></p>
        <p>The variable <span class="emph">y</span> only exists while the function is being executed - we call this
            its <strong>lifetime</strong>. When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local
            variables are destroyed. PythonTutor helps you visualize this because the local variables disappear after
            the function returns. Go back and step through the statements paying particular attention to the variables
            that are created when the function is called. Note when they are subsequently destroyed as the function
            returns.</p>
        <p>Formal parameters are also local and act like local variables. For example, the lifetime
            of <span class="emph">x</span> begins when square is called, and its lifetime ends when the function completes its
            execution.</p>
        <p>So it is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then
            when it is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local
            variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it is legal for a function to access a global variable. However, this is
            considered <strong>bad form</strong> by nearly all programmers and should be avoided. Look at the
            following, nonsensical variation of the square function.</p>
        <p><iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/WritingFunctionsGlobalVars1"></iframe></p>
        <p>Although the <span><code class="language-python">badsquare()</code></span> function works, it is silly
            and poorly written. We have done it here to illustrate an important rule about how variables are looked up
            in Python. First, Python looks at the variables that are defined as local variables in the function. We call
            this the <strong>local scope</strong>. If the variable name is not found in the local scope, then
            Python looks at the global variables, or <strong>global scope</strong>. This is exactly the case
            illustrated in the code above. <span class="emph">power</span> is not found locally in <span><code class="language-python">badsquare()</code></span>
            but it does exist globally. The appropriate way to write this function would be to pass power as a parameter. For practice,
            you should rewrite the <span><code class="language-python">badsquare()</code></span> example to have a second parameter called power.</p>
        <p>Below is another nonsensical example of a square and a cube function. What happens when you try to run this
            program?</p>
        <p><iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20badsquare%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20y%20%3D%20x%20**%20power%0A%20%20return%20y%0A%0Adef%20badcube%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20y%20%3D%20x%20**%20power%0A%20%20return%20y%0A%0Apower%20%3D%202%0Aresult%20%3D%20badsquare%2810%29%0Aprint%28result%29%0A%0Apower%20%3D%203%0Aresult%20%3D%20badcube%2810%29%0Aprint%28result%29%0A%0Aresult%20%3D%20badsquare%2810%29%0Aprint%28result%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe></p>
        <p>There is another variation on this theme of local versus
            global variables. Assignment statements in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">local
                function</span> cannot change variables defined <span style="text-decoration: underline;">outside
            </span>the function, without further (discouraged) special syntax. Consider the following pythontutor
            example:</p>
        <p><iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20powerof%28x,p%29%3A%0A%20%20power%20%3D%20p%20%23%20Another%20dumb%20mistake%0A%20%20y%20%3D%20x%20**%20power%0A%20%20return%20y%0A%0Apower%20%3D%203%0Aresult%20%3D%20powerof%2810,2%29%0Aprint%28power%29%0Aprint%28result%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe></p>
        <p>What do you notice about the values of variable <span class="emph">power</span> in the local scope compared to the variable power in
            the global scope?</p>
        <p>The value of <span class="emph">power</span> in the local scope was different than the global scope. That is because in this
            example power was used on the left hand side of the assignment statement <span><code class="language-python">power = p</code></span>. When a
            variable name is used on the left hand side of an assignment statement Python creates a local variable. When
            a local variable has the same name as a global variable we say that the local shadows the global.
            A <strong>shadow</strong> means that the global variable cannot be accessed by Python because the
            local variable will be found first. This is another good reason not to use global variables. As you can see,
            it makes your code confusing and difficult to understand.</p>
        <p>To cement all of these ideas even further lets look at one final example. Inside
            the <span><code class="language-python">square()</code></span> function we are going to make an assignment to the parameter <span class="emph">x</span> There's
            no good reason to do this other than to emphasize the fact that the parameter <span class="emph">x</span> is a local
            variable. If you step through the example below you will see that although <span class="emph">x</span> is 0 in the
            local variables for <span><code class="language-python">square()</code></span>, the <span class="emph">x</span> in the global scope remains 2. This is confusing to many
            beginning programmers who think that an assignment to a formal parameter will cause a change to the value of
            the variable that was used as the actual parameter, especially when the two share the same name. But this
            example demonstrates that that is clearly not how Python operates.</p>
