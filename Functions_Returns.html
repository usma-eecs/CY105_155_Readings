        <p>Most functions require arguments, values that control how the function does its job. For example, if you want
            to find the absolute value of a number, you have to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in
            function for computing the absolute value:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">print(abs(5)) # displays 5
print(abs(-5)) #also displays 5</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the arguments to the <span><code class="language-python">abs()</code></span> function are <span class = "emph">5</span> and <span class = "emph">-5</span>.</p>
        <p>Some functions take more than one argument. For example the math module contains a function called pow which
            takes two arguments, the base and the exponent. Another built-in function that takes more than one argument
            is max.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">import math
#math.pow()
print(math.pow(2, 3)) # 8.0
print(math.pow(7, 4)) # 2401.0
#max()
print(max(7, 11)) # 11
print(max(4, 1, 17, 2, 12)) #17
print(max(3 * 11, 5 ** 3, 512 - 19, 1024 ** 0)) #503</code></pre>
        <p>The <span><code class="language-python">max()</code></span> function can be sent any number of arguments, 
            separated by commas, and will return the maximum value
            sent. The arguments can be either simple values or expressions. In the last example, <span class = "emph">503</span> is returned, since
            it is larger than <span class = "emph">33</span>, <span class = "emph">125</span>, and <span class = "emph">1</span>. Note that max also works on lists of values.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, functions like <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span>, <span><code class="language-python">int()</code></span>, 
            <span><code class="language-python">abs()</code></span> all return values that can be used to build more complex expressions.</p>
        <p>So an important difference between these functions and one like drawSquare is
            that <span class = "emph">drawSquare</span> was not executed because we wanted it to compute a value - on the contrary,
            we wrote <span class = "emph">drawSquare</span> because we wanted it to execute a sequence of steps that caused the turtle to
            draw a specific shape.</p>
        <p>Functions that return values are sometimes called<strong> fruitful functions</strong>. A chunk that doesn't return a value is called
            a <em>non-fruitful</em> function.</p>
        <p>Fruitful functions still allow the user to provide information (arguments). However there is now an
            additional piece of data that is returned from the function.</p>
        <img src="Images/Functions_02_FruitfulBlackBox.png" />
        <p>How do we write our own fruitful function? Let's start by creating a very simple mathematical function
            that we will call square. The square function will take one number as a parameter and return the result
            of squaring that number. Here is the black-box diagram with the Python code following.</p>
        <img src="Images/Functions_02_SquareBlackBox.png" />

        <p>The <span><code class="language-python">return</code></span> statement is followed
            by an expression which is evaluated. Its result is returned to the caller as the "fruit" of
            calling this function. Because the <span><code class="language-python">return</code></span> statement can contain any 
            Python expression we could have avoided
            creating the temporary variable <span class = "emph">squared</span> and simply used <span><code class="language-python">return base**2</code></span>. Try
            modifying the <span class = "emph">square</span> function above to see that this works just the same. On the other hand,
            using temporary variables like <span class = "emph">squared</span> in the program above makes debugging
            easier. These temporary variables are examples of <strong>local variables</strong>, pursued further in
            the next section.</p>
        <p>Notice something important here. The name of the variable we pass as an argument - <span class = "emph">to_square</span> - has
            nothing to do with the name of the formal parameter - <span class = "emph">base</span>. It is as if <span><code class="language-python">base = to_square</code></span> is executed when
            <span class = "emph">square</span> is called. It doesn't matter what the value was named in the caller. In <span class = "emph">square</span>, it's name
            is <span class = "emph">base</span>. You can see this very clearly here: 
            <iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20square%28base%29%3A%0A%20%20squared%20%3D%20base%20**%202%0A%20%20return%20squared%0A%0Ato_square%20%3D%2010%0Aresult%20%3D%20square%28to_square%29%0Aprint%28%22The%20result%20of%22,%20to_square,%20%22squared%20is%22,%20result%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=5&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>
            The <strong>global variables</strong> (variables defined outside of any function) and the local
            variables for the <span class = "emph">square</span> function are in separate boxes.</p>
        <p>Step through the example, notice that the <span><code class="language-python">return</code></span> statement not only
            causes the function to <strong>return</strong> a value, but it also returns the flow of control back to
            the place in the program where the function call was made.</p>
        <p>Another important thing to notice as you step through this pythontutor demonstration is the movement of the
            red and green arrows. Pythontutor uses these arrows to show you where it is currently executing. Recall that
            the red arrow always points to the next line of code that will be executed. The light green arrow points to
            the line that was just executed in the last step.</p>
        <p>When you first start running this pythontutor demonstration you will notice that there is only a red arrow
            and it points to line 1. This is because line 1 is the next line to be executed and since it is the first
            line, there is no previously executed line of code.</p>
        <p>When you click on the <em>next &gt;</em> button, notice that the red arrow moves to line 5, skipping lines 2 and 3 of
            the function (and the light green arrow has now appeared on line 1). Why is this? The answer is that
            function definition is not the same as function execution. Lines 2 and 3 will not be executed until the
            function is called on line 6. Line 1 defines the function and the name square is added to the global
            variables, but that is all the def does at that point. The body of the function will be executed later.
            Continue to click the <em>next &gt;</em> button to see how the flow of control moves from the call, back up to the
            body of the function, and then finally back to line 7, after the function has returned its value and the
            value has been assigned to <span class = "emph">result</span>.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is one more aspect of function return values that should be noted. All Python functions return
            the value <span><code class="language-python">None</code></span> unless there is an explicit return statement with a value other than None. Consider the
            following common mistake made by beginning Python programmers. As you step through this example, pay very
            close attention to the return value in the local variables listing. Then look at what is printed when the
            function returns.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/WritingFunctionsReturnsNone"></iframe>
        <p>The problem with this function is that even though it prints the value of the square, that value will not be
            returned to the place where the call was made. Since line 6 uses the return value as the right hand side of
            an assignment statement, the evaluation of the function will be <span><code class="language-python">None</code></span>. In this
            case, <span class = "emph">result</span> will refer to that value after the assignment statement and therefore the
            result printed in line 7 is incorrect. Typically, functions will return values that can be printed or
            processed in some other way by the caller.</p>
