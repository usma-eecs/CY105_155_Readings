        <p>Newton's method to calculate square roots is an example of an algorithm that repeats as long as it can
            improve the result. It's just a variation of our accumulator pattern. Many algorithms work this way
            and so require the use of indefinite iteration.</p>
        <p>Here is another accumulator pattern program. It adds up the reciprocals of powers of two.</p>

        <p>You may have studied this sequence in a math class and learned that the sum approaches but never reaches 2.0.
            That is true in theory. However, when we implement this summation in a program, we see something different.

        <p><strong>Modify the program...</strong></p>
        <p>If the sum never reaches 2.0, the loop would never terminate. But the loop does stop! How many repetitions
            did it make before it stopped?</p>
        <p>On line 7 (not indented), print the value of <span><code class="language-python">a_number</code></span> and you will see.</p>
        <p>But <strong>why</strong> did it reach 2.0? Are those math teachers wrong?</p>
