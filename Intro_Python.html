        <p>The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language;
            other <strong>high-level languages</strong> you might have heard of are C++, PHP, and Java.
            <br /><br />As you might infer from the name high-level language, there are also <strong>low-level
                languages</strong>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Machine language
            is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer. Assembly
            language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions. Loosely speaking, computers
            can only execute programs written in low-level languages. To be exact, computers can actually only execute
            programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in
            assembly language) have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is
            a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.
            <br /><br />First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level
            language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be
            correct. Second, high-level languages are <strong>portable</strong>, meaning that they can run on
            different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of
            computer and have to be rewritten to run on another. <br /><br />Due to these advantages, almost all
            programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
            applications. <br /><br />Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level
            languages: <strong>interpreters</strong> and <strong>compilers</strong>. An interpreter reads
            a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a
            little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.</p>
        <p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case,
            the high-level program is called the <strong>source code</strong>. The compiler translates the source
            code into an <strong>executable</strong>. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly
            without further translation.</p>

        <p><br />Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language,
            called <strong>byte code</strong>, and then interpreted by a program called a <strong>virtual
                machine</strong>. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is
            usually considered an interpreted language. <br /><br />You can write an entire program by placing lines of
            Python instructions in a file and then use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file as a whole.
            Such a file is often referred to as <strong>source code</strong>. For example, we used a text editor to
            create a source code file named firstprogram.py with the following contents:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">print("My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:")
print(2 + 3)</code></pre>
