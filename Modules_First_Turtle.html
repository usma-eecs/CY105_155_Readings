        <p>There are many <strong>modules</strong> in Python that provide very powerful features that we can use in our own
            programs. Some of these can send email or fetch web pages. Others allow us to perform complex mathematical
            calculations. Here, we will introduce a module that allows us to create a data object called a
            <strong>turtle</strong> that can be used to draw pictures.</p>
        <p>Turtle graphics, as it is known, is based on a very simple metaphor. Imagine that you have a turtle that
            understands English. You can tell your turtle to do simple commands such as go forward and turn right. As
            the turtle moves around, if its tail is down touching the ground, it will draw a line (leave a trail behind)
            as it moves. If you tell your turtle to lift up its tail it can still move around but will not leave a
            trail. As you will see, you can make some pretty amazing drawings with this simple capability.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The turtles are fun, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves a
            little more Python and to develop our theme of computational thinking, or thinking like a computer
            scientist. Most of the Python covered here will be explored in more depth later.</p>
        <p>Let's try a couple of lines of Python code to create a new turtle and start drawing a simple figure
            like a rectangle. We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name alex, but remember that you can
            choose any name you wish as long as you follow the naming rules from the previous chapter.</p>
        <p>The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the rectangle. After line 5 you will have a
            straight line going from the center of the drawing canvas towards the right. After line 7, you will have a
            canvas with a turtle and a half drawn rectangle. Press the run button to try it and see. Now see if you can
            complete the other two sides of the rectangle!</p>

        <p>Here are a couple of things you'll need to understand about this program.</p>
        <p>The first line tells Python to load a <strong>module</strong> named <span
                class = "emph">turtle</span>. That module brings us two new types
            that we can use: the <span class = "emph">Turtle</span> type, and the
            <span class = "emph">Screen</span> type. The dot notation <span><code class="language-python">turtle.Turtle()</code></span> 
            means "The Turtle type that is defined within the turtle module". (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the module
            name, <span><code class="language-python">turtle</code></span>, with a lowercase t, is
            different from the type <span><code class="language-python">Turtle</code></span> because of
            the uppercase T.)</p>
        <p>We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would prefer to call it a window), 
            which we assign to variable <span><code class="language-python">wn</code></span>. Every window contains a
            <strong>canvas</strong>, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.</p>
        <p>In line 4 we create a turtle. The variable <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span> 
            is made to refer to this turtle. These first three lines set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.</p>
        <p>In lines 5-7, we instruct the <strong>object</strong> <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span> to move and to turn. We do this by
            <strong>invoking</strong> or activating alex's <strong>methods</strong> - these are the
            instructions that all turtles know how to respond to. Here the dot indicates that the methods invoked belong
            to and refer to the object <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span>.</p>
        <p>An object can have various methods - things it can do - and it can also have
            <strong>attributes</strong> - (sometimes called <em>properties</em>). For example, each turtle has a
            <em>color</em> attribute. The method invocation <span><code class="language-python">alex.color("red")</code></span> will make <span><code class="language-python">alex</code></span>
            red and the line that it draws will be red too.</p>
        <p>The color of the turtle, the width of its pen (tail), the position of the turtle within the window, which way
            it is facing, and so on are all part of its current <strong>state</strong>. Similarly, the window object has
            a background color which is part of its state.</p>
        <p>Quite a number of methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and window objects. In the example below,
            we show just show a couple and have only commented those lines that are different from the previous example.
            Note also that we have decided to call our turtle object <span><code class="language-python">tess</code></span> to
            emphasize that you can name the turtles almost anything you want.</p>
        <p>See if you can complete tess's triangle!</p>
