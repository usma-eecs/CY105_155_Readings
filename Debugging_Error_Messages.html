        <p>Many problems in your program will lead to an error message. For example as I was writing and testing this
            chapter of the book I wrote the following version of the example program in the previous section.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">current_time_str = input("What is the current time (in hours 0-23)?")
wait_time_str = input("How many hours do you want to wait")

current_time_int = int(current_time_str)
wait_time_int = int(wait_time_int)

final_time_int = current_time_int + wait_time_int
print(final_time_int)
</code></pre>
        <p>Can you see what is wrong, just by looking at the code? Maybe, maybe not. Our brain tends to see what we
            think is there, so sometimes it is very hard to find the problem just by looking at the code. Especially
            when it is our own code and we are sure that we have done everything right!</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at the program in our editor:</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingNameError"></iframe>
        <p>Aha! Now we have an error message that might be useful. The
            name error tells us that <span class = "emph">wait_time_int</span> is not defined. It also tells us that the error is on line
            5. That's <strong>really</strong> useful information. Now look at line five and you will see
            that <span class = "emph">wait_time_int</span> is used on both the left and the right hand side of the assignment statement.
        </p>
        <p>From looking at code over several years, it is apparent that nearly 90% of the error messages encountered for
            this problem are <strong>SyntaxError</strong>, <strong>TypeError</strong>, <strong>NameError</strong>, or <strong>ValueError</strong>. 
            We will look at these errors in three stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First we will define what these four error messages mean.</li>
            <li>Then, we will look at some examples that cause these errors to occur.</li>
            <li>Finally we will look at ways to help uncover the root cause of these messages</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>SyntaxError</h3>
        <p>Syntax errors happen when you make an error in the syntax of your program. Syntax errors are like making
            grammatical errors in writing. If you don't use periods and commas in your writing then you are making
            it hard for other readers to figure out what you are trying to say. Similarly Python has certain grammatical
            rules that must be followed or else Python can't figure out what you are trying to say.</p>
        <p>Usually Syntax errors can be traced back to missing punctuation characters, such as parentheses, quotation
            marks, or commas. Remember that in Python commas are used to separate parameters to functions. Parentheses
            must be balanced, or else Python thinks that you are trying to include everything that follows as a
            parameter to some function.</p>
        <p>Here are a couple examples of Syntax errors in the example program we have been using. See if you can figure
            out what caused them.</p>
            <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingSyntaxError"></iframe>
        <p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> How can you help yourself find these problems? One trick that can be very valuable in this situation is to simply start
            by commenting out the line number that is flagged as having the error. If you comment out line four, the
            error message now changes to point to line 5. Now you ask yourself, am I really that bad that I have two
            lines in a row that have errors on them? Maybe, so taken to the extreme, you could comment out all of the
            remaining lines in the program. Now the error message changes to <span><code class="language-python-repl">SyntaxError: EOF in multi-line
            statement on line 9 ^ in main.py</code></span>. This is a very technical way of saying that Python got to the end of file
            (EOF) while it was still looking for something. In this case a right parenthesis.</p>
            <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingSyntaxError2"></iframe>
        <p></strong><strong>Finding Clues</strong> If you
            follow the same advice as for the last problem, comment out line one, you will immediately get a different
            error message. Here's where you need to be very careful and not panic. The error message you get now
            is: <span><code class="language-python-repl">NameError: name 'current_time_str' is not defined on line 4</code></span>. You might be very tempted to think
            that this is somehow related to the earlier problem and immediately conclude that there is something wrong
            with the variable name <span class = "emph">current_time_str</span> but if you reflect for a minute you will see that by
            commenting out line one you have caused a new and unrelated error. That is you have commented out the
            creation of the name <span class = "emph">current_time_str</span>. So of course when you want to convert it to an int you
            will get the NameError. Yes, this can be confusing, but it will become much easier with experience.
            It's also important to keep calm, and evaluate each new clue carefully so you don't waste time
            chasing problems that are not really there.</p>
        <p>Uncomment line 1 and you are back to the SyntaxError. Another track is to eliminate a possible source of
            error. Rather than commenting out the entire line you might just try to assign <span class = "emph">current_time_str</span> to
            a constant value. For example you might make line one look like this: <br><span><code class="language-python">current_time_str = "10"
            #input("What is the "current time" (in hours 0-23)?")</code></span>. Now you have assigned <span class = "emph">current_time_str</span> to
            the string 10, and commented out the input statement. And now the program works! So you conclude that the
            problem must have something to do with the input function.</p>
        <h2>TypeError</h2>
        <p>Type errors occur when you you try to combine two objects that are not compatible. For example you try to add
            together an integer and a string. Usually type errors can be isolated to lines that are using mathematical
            operators, and usually the line number given by the error message is an accurate indication of the line.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of a type error created by a Polish learner. See if you can find and fix the error.
        </p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingTypeError"></iframe>
        <p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> One thing
            that can help you in this situation is to print out the values and the types of the variables involved in
            the statement that is causing the error. You might try adding a print statement after line 4 <span><code class="language-python">print(x,
            type(x))</code></span> You will see that at least we have confirmed that <span class = "emph">x</span> is of type string. Now you need to start
            to work backward through the program. You need to ask yourself, where is <span class = "emph">x</span> used in the program? <span class = "emph">x</span> is used on
            lines 2, 3, and of course 5 and 6 (where we are getting an error). So maybe you move the print statement to
            be after line 2 and again after 3. Line 3 is where you expect the value of <span class = "emph">x</span> to be changed to an integer.
            Could line 4 be mysteriously changing <span class = "emph">x</span> back to a string? Not very likely. So the value and type of <span class = "emph">x</span> is
            just what you would expect it to be after line 2, but not after line 3. This helps you isolate the problem
            to line 3. In fact if you employ one of our earlier techniques of commenting out line 3 you will see that
            this has no impact on the error, and is a big clue that line 3 as it is currently written is useless.</p>
        <h2>NameError</h2>
        <p>Name errors almost always mean that you have used a variable before it has a value. Often NameErrors are
            simply caused by typos in your code. They can be hard to spot if you don't have a good eye for
            catching spelling mistakes. Other times you may simply mis-remember the name of a variable or even a
            function you want to call. You have seen one example of a NameError at the beginning of this section. Here
            is another one. See if you can get this program to run successfully:</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingNameError2"></iframe>
        <p><strong>Finding Clues</strong> With name
            errors one of the best things you can do is use the editor, or browser search function. Quite often if you
            search for the exact word in the error message one of two things will happen:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The word you are searching for will appear only once in your code, it's also likely that it will
                be on the right hand side of an assignment statement, or as a parameter to a function. That should
                confirm for you that you have a typo somewhere. If the name in
                question <strong>is</strong> what you thought it should be then you probably have a typo on
                the left hand side of an assignment statement on a line before your error message occurs. Start looking
                backward at your assignment statements. In some cases it's really nice to leave all the
                highlighted strings from the search function visible as they will help you very quickly find a line
                where you might have expected your variable to be highlighted.</li>
            <li>The second thing that may happen is that you will be looking directly at a line where you expected the
                search to find the string in question, but it will not be highlighted. Most often that will be the typo
                right there.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is another one for you to try:</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingNameError3"></iframe>
        <p>And one last bit of code to fix.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingNameError4"></iframe>
        <h2>ValueError</h2>
        <p>Value errors occur when you pass a parameter to a function and the function is expecting certain
            limitations on the values, and the value passed is not compatible. We can illustrate that with this
            particular program in two different ways.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/DebuggingValueError"></iframe>
        <p>Run the program but instead of typing in anything to the
            dialog box, hit the "Enter" key on your keyboard. You should see the following error message: <span><code class="language-python-repl">ValueError:
            invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''</code></span>. This error is not because you have made a mistake in your
            program. Although sometimes we do want to check the user input to make sure its valid, but we don't
            have all the tools we need for that yet. The error happens because the user did not give us something we can
            convert to an integer, instead we gave it an empty string. Try running the program again. Now this time
            enter "ten" instead of the number 10. You will get a similar error message.</p>
        <p>ValueErrors are not always caused by user input error, but in this program that is the case. 
            For now it is worth repeating that you need to keep track of the restrictions needed for your variables, and understand what your function is
            expecting. You can do this by writing comments in your code, or by naming your variables in a way that
            reminds you of their proper form.</p>
