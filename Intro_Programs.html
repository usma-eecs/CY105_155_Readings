        <p>A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be
            something as complex as rendering an html page in a web browser or encoding a video and streaming it across
            the network. It can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching for and replacing text in a document
            or (strangely enough) compiling a program. <br /><br />The details look different in different languages,
            but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language.</p>
        <p><strong>input</strong> <br />Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</p>
        <p><strong>output</strong> <br />Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</p>
        <p><strong>math and logic</strong> <br />Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
            multiplication
            and logical operations like <span><code class="language-python">and</code></span>, <span><code
                    class="language-python">or</code></span>, and <span><code class="language-python">not</code></span>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>conditional execution</strong></br>Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate
            sequence of statements.</p>
        <p><strong>repetition</strong> <br />Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program you've ever used, no
            matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe
            programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the
            subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic instructions.</p>
