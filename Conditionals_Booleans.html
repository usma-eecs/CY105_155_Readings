        <p>The Python type for storing true and false values is called bool, named after the British mathematician,
            George Boole. George Boole created Boolean Algebra, which is the basis of all modern computer arithmetic.
        </p>
        <p>There are only two <strong>boolean</strong> values. They are <span><code class="language-python">True</code></span> and <span><code class="language-python">False</code></span>.
            Capitalization is important, since true and false are not boolean values (remember
            Python is case sensitive). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Boolean values are not strings!</span>
            It is extremely important to realize that True and False are not strings. They are not surrounded by quotes.
            They are the only two values in the data type bool. Take a close look at the types shown below.</p>

        <p>A<strong> boolean expression</strong> is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.
            The equality operator, <span><code class="language-python">==</code></span>, compares two values and produces a boolean value related to whether the two
            values are equal to one another.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/CY105-155-Readings/ConditionalsBooleans2"></iframe>
        <p>In the first statement, the two operands are equal, so the
            expression evaluates to True. In the second statement, 5 is not equal to 6, so we get False.</p>
        <p>The <span><code class="language-python">==</code></span> operator is one of six common <strong>comparison operators</strong>; the others are:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">x != y               # x is not equal to y
x &gt; y                # x is greater than y
x &lt; y                # x is less than y
x &gt;= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
x &lt;= y               # x is less than or equal to y
</code></pre>
        <p>Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the
            mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (<span><code class="language-python">=</code></span>) instead of a double equal sign (<span><code class="language-python">==</code></span>).
            Remember that <span><code class="language-python">=</code></span> is an assignment operator and <span><code class="language-python">==</code></span> is a comparison operator. Also, there
            is no such thing as =&lt; or =&gt;.</p>
        <p>Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For example, if <span><code class="language-python">a == 7</code></span>
            then <span><code class="language-python">7 == a</code></span>. But in Python, the statement 
            <span><code class="language-python">a = 7</code></span> is legal and <span><code class="language-python">7 = a</code></span> is not.
            (Can you explain why?)</p>
