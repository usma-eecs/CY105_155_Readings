        <p>It turns out that generating lists with a specific number of integers is a very common thing to do,
            especially when you want to write simple <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop controlled iteration. Even
            though you can use any four items, or any four integers for that matter, the conventional thing to do is to
            use a list of integers starting with <span class = "emph">0</span>. In fact, these lists are so popular that Python gives us special
            built-in <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span> objects that can deliver a sequence of values to the
            <span><code class="language-python">for</code></span> loop. When called with one parameter, the sequence provided by
            <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span> always starts with <span class = "emph">0</span>. If you ask for <span><code class="language-python">range(4)</code></span>,
            then you will get <span class = "emph">4</span> values starting with <span class = "emph">0</span>. In other words, <span class = "emph">0, 1, 2, and 3</span>. 
            Notice that <span class = "emph">4</span> is not included since we started with <span class = "emph">0</span>. Likewise, 
            <span><code class="language-python">range(10)</code></span> provides <span class = "emph">10</span> values, <span class = "emph">0</span> 
            through <span class = "emph">9</span>.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(4):
        # Executes the body with i = 0, then 1, then 2, then 3
for x in range(10):
    # sets x to each of ... [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</code></pre>
        <p><span style="background-color: #bfedd2;">Note: Computer scientists like to count from 0!</span></p>
        <p>So to repeat something four times, a good Python programmer would do this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(4):
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)</code></pre>
        <p>The <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span> function is actually a very powerful function
            when it comes to creating sequences of integers. It can take one, two, or three parameters. We have seen the
            simplest case of one parameter such as <span><code class="language-python">range(4)</code></span>which
            creates<span><code class="language-python">[0, 1, 2, 3]</code></span>. But what if we really want to have the
            sequence <span><code class="language-python">[1, 2, 3, 4]</code></span>? We can do this by using a two parameter version
            of <span><code class="language-python">range()</code></span> where the first parameter is the starting point and the second
            parameter is the ending point. The evaluation of<span><code class="language-python">range(1, 5)</code></span>produces 
            the desired sequence. What happened to the 5? In this case we interpret the parameters of the range function to 
            mean <span><code class="language-python">range(start,beyondLast)</code></span>, where <strong>beyondLast</strong> 
            means an index past the last index we want. In the 2-parameter version of range, that is the last index included + 1.</p>
        <p>Here are a two examples for you to run. Try them and then add another line below to create a sequence
            starting at <span class = "emph">10</span> and going up to <span class = "emph">20</span> (including <span class = "emph">20</span>).</p>

        <p>Finally, suppose we want to have a sequence of even numbers. How would we do that? Easy, we add another
                parameter, a <strong>step</strong>, that tells range what to count by. For even numbers we want to start at 0 and count
                by 2s. So if we wanted the first 10 even numbers we would use <span><code class="language-python">range(0,19,2)</code></span>. 
                The most general form of the range is <span><code class="language-python">range(start, beyondLast, step)</code></span>. 
                You can also create a sequence of numbers that starts big and gets smaller by using a negative value for the step parameter.</p>
